    "tatyana_tarasova_text": "Recently, I decided to drill a well for water. I found a couple of well drilling companies online, called them all, and settled on this website. I liked that everything was explained, and the price for well drilling was not high. Specialists arrived at the agreed time and drilled the well in 9 hours. I was happy that it was so fast!!! They didn't splash the house, it remained clean, they answered all my, perhaps, funny questions, and explained how to use the well. Thank you guys for a very fast and high-quality job.",

    "ruslan_parhomenko_text": "The well work was done 1-quickly, 2-very high quality (although the conditions were not easy - a hard-to-reach place where other drilling rigs could not enter). I didn't even think there would be water in such a place. As a result, we have been using water for more than a month, and thank you for your advice on maintaining the equipment's performance.",

We have been using it for half a year and are satisfied. I have no complaints about the price, quality of work, or the result. Thank you, I will recommend you as professionals!"
